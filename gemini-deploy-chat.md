# Gemini Deploy Chat - Final Workflow

That's a great plan! You've outlined a solid workflow for building, deploying, and updating your Cloud Run service. Let's break down each step and provide some code examples to get you started.

> Step 1: Build Docker Image Locally

- **Dockerfile:** Make sure you have a Dockerfile in your project root that defines how to build your container image. You can use the examples from the search results I provided earlier, tailoring them to your specific Node.js application.
- **Build Command:** Use the following command to build your Docker image locally:

  ```bash
  docker build -t gcr.io/your-project-id/nodejs-app:latest .
  ```
  
  - Replace `your-project-id` with your actual Google Cloud Project ID.
  - The `-t` flag specifies the image tag (name and version).

---

> Step 2: Push to Google Container Registry

- **Authenticate:** Before pushing, you need to authenticate with Google Container Registry. Use the following command:

  ```bash
  gcloud auth configure-docker
  ```

- **Push Command:** Push your image to GCR:

  ```bash
  docker push gcr.io/your-project-id/nodejs-app:latest
  ```

---

> Step 3: Create Cloud Run Service in Console

- **Navigate:** Go to the Cloud Run section in your Google Cloud Console.
- **Create Service:** Click "Create Service" and follow the steps.
- **Container Image:** In the "Container Image" field, enter the full URL of your image in GCR: `gcr.io/your-project-id/nodejs-app:latest .`
- **Settings:** Configure any additional settings you need, such as memory, CPU, traffic routing, environment variables, etc.

---

> Step 4: Github Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloud Run

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  PROJECT_ID: your-project-id # Replace with your Google Cloud Project ID
  REGION: us-central1 # Replace with your desired region
  IMAGE_NAME: gcr.io/your-project-id/nodejs-app # Replace with your image name
  SERVICE_NAME: nodejs-app # Replace with your desired Cloud Run service name

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Login to Google Container Registry
        uses: google-github-actions/auth@v0
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: projects/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-actions/providers/github-actions-oidc
          create_credentials_file: true

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest .

      - name: Push Docker image to Container Registry
        run: docker push ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest

      - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
        run: gcloud run deploy ${{ env.SERVICE_NAME }} --image ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest --region ${{ env.REGION }}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Environment Variables:** Set up environment variables for your project ID, region, image name, and service name.
- **Login to GCR:** Use the google-github-actions/auth action to authenticate to GCR.
- **Build and Push:** Build and push your Docker image using the docker build and docker push commands.
- **Deploy to Cloud Run:** Use the gcloud run deploy command to deploy your image to Cloud Run. The --image flag specifies the image to use, and --region sets the region for your service.

**Key Points:**

- **Service Account:** Make sure you have a service account with the necessary permissions to build, push, and deploy to Cloud Run.
- **Secrets:** Store your service account email and other sensitive information as secrets in your GitHub repository.
- **Workflow Trigger:** This workflow will trigger on every push to the main branch. You can customize this to your needs.

## Create Docker File

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "start"]
