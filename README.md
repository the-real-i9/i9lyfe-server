## My Content Recommendation Algorithm

### User Home Feed Population Re-Implementation

- When a user comes online (i.e establishes a WebSocket connection), he joins the list of users listening for recommended posts in a `sync.Map`.
  - When a user goes offline (i.e tears-down a WebSocket connection), he is removed from the list of users listening for recommended posts in a `sync.Map`.

- In the `sync.Map`, each user's `username` is mapped to a`[2]any`, the first item holds the user's socket pipe `*websocket.Conn`, while the second hosts a recommended posts queue `[]string`, where recommended posts are kept (by `id`) until the user pulls them.
  - When the post queue contains at least one post, the user is notified of the availability of new posts.
  - When the user pulls them, we get all posts whose `id` is present in the recommended posts queue, sort them according to time created in descending order, and send them to the user.

- If the user is offline (i.e. its key isn't found in the list of users listening for recommended posts, `sync.Map`), the post is queued in the database instead.
  - When the user comes online, we get all posts whose `id` is present in the user recommended posts list, sort them according to time created in descending order, and send them to the user.

### Expolre Feed Content Recommedation Algorithm

### User Home Feed Content Recommendation Algorithm

We recommend posts to users based on their follow network and their interests.

Determining a user's follow network is easy. Determining their interests requires technicality. That's why this algorithm is about determining user's interests.
