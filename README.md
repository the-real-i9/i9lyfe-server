# i9lyfe (API Server)

Build your Social Network Application

## Intro

i9lyfe-server is an API server for a Social Network Application, built with Node.js. It supports major social network application features that can be used to implement a mordern social network application.

### Who is this project for?

If you're a frontend developer looking to build a Social Network Application, not just to have it static, but to also make it function.

The goal of this API server is to support as many Social Network features as possible.

The API documentation provides a detailed usage guide. It doesn't follow the Open API specification, rather it follows Google's API documentation style sturcured in a simple markdown table, which I consider easier to work with.

### Open to suggestions

If your needs require more features than this API server currently supports, feel free to suggest them, and it will be added as soon as possible.
