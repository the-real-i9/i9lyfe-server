For all **HTTP request/response communication**: [Here](./.apidoc/openapi.json)'s a well-written OpenAPI JSON document. Drop or Import it into a [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?_gl=1*1numedn*_gcl_au*MTUxNDUxNjEuMTc0MjY1MTg5Nw..) to access it.

For all **WebSocket real-time communication**: [Here](./.apidoc/websocketsapi.md)'s a written markdown document.
