	// the order of the comment list returned isn't evaluated based on date_created only
	// therefore, you shouldn't assume that the last or first item is the least recent item,
	// rather, you should programmatically find the least recent item in the list,
	// doing otherwise would cause items in previous pages to be returned and some items even missing
